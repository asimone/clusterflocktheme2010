=====================

Clusterflock.org Revised Theme. It's a mess and wasn't really meant to be used on other sites.


You probably shouldn't use this theme, it's really more for archival purposes. It's old and may not be compatible with Wordpress

It was designed by Chris Glass and developed by Andrew Simone.

This Theme is under GPL License. (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php)

INSTALL: 
1. Unpack this archive in your wp-content/themes/ directory.
2. Go to Admin WordPress and select presentation.
3. Select Clusterflock theme

Questions, bugs and others can be emailed me to andrew.simone@gmail.com.
